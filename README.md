What is Skin Cancer?

Most skin cancers are locally destructive cancerous (malignant) growth of the skin. They originate from the cells of the epidermis, the superficial layer of the skin. Unlike cutaneous malignant melanoma, the vast majority of these sorts of skin cancers rarely spread to other parts of the body (metastasize) and become life-threatening.

There are three major types of skin cancer: (1) basal cell carcinoma (the most common), (2) squamous cell carcinoma (the second most common), which originate from skin cells, and (3) melanoma, which originates from the pigment-producing skin cells (melanocytes) but is less common, though more dangerous, than the first two varieties. Other rare forms of skin cancer include lymphomas, Merkel cell cancers, and cancers of other tissue in the skin, including sarcomas as well as hair and sweat gland tumors. In this article, we will only be reviewing the most common forms of cancers, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.

What causes skin cancer?

Except in rare instances, most skin cancers arise from DNA mutations induced by ultraviolet light affecting cells of the epidermis. Many of these early cancers seem to be controlled by natural immune surveillance, which when compromised, may permit the development of masses of malignant cells that begin to grow into tumors.

What are the different types of skin cancer?
There are several different types of skin cancers:

1)Basal cell carcinoma: is the most common cancer in humans. Over 1 million new cases of basal cell carcinoma are diagnosed in the U.S. each year. There are several different types of basal cell carcinoma, including the superficial type, the least worrisome variety; the nodular type, the most common; and the morpheaform, the most challenging to treat because the tumors often grow into the surrounding tissue (infiltrate) without a well-defined border.

2)Squamous cell carcinoma: accounts for about 20% of all skin cancers but is more common in immunosuppressed people. In most instances, its biologic behavior is much like basal cell carcinoma with a small but significant chance of distant spread.

3)Melanoma:Melanoma occurs when the pigment-producing cells that give colour to the skin become cancerous.
Symptoms might include a new, unusual growth or a change in an existing mole. Melanomas can occur anywhere on the body.
Treatment may involve surgery, radiation, medication or in some cases, chemotherapy.

Skin Cancer is the most common cancer in the world.Melanomas are the ones that typically kill people, it is also known as the 'Black cancer'.

Following image shows the difference in survival probability for the different stages,

Above image show us the stages of skin cancer and as you can see at Stage Zero cancer has barely penetrated the surface, but it is very visible.But at the stage IV the cancer has just grown below the skin layer and touched the underlying tissue and vessels.it is not spread yet but with this kind of cancer which can develop in less than a year. your survival rate is would be 20%. therefore early detection is required to take effective measures
